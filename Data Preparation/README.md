# DS/ML Literacy

## Insufficient Data
* No great solutions for insufficient data. Simply need to find more data sources
### Dealing with insufficient data
1. choose simpler model : 
   * with fewer parameters
   * e.g. Naive bayes,logistic regression
   * enseble learning
2. Transfer Learning : Transfer learning (TL) is a research problem in machine learning (ML) that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. For example, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could apply when trying to recognize trucks.

3. Data Augmentation : 1. increase the number of trainning samples 2. perturbed images are a form of data augmentation
4. Systhetic data 

## Too much data
